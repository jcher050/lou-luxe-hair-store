# Lou Luxe Hair Store – Azure Cloud Project

Welcome to the Lou Luxe Hair Store cloud project, designed to demonstrate hands-on skills in Azure cloud architecture, database management, and cybersecurity. This project aligns with the core learning objectives from the following certifications:
- AZ-104: Azure Administrator
- AZ-305: Azure Solutions Architect
- DP-300: Azure Database Administrator
- CySA+: CompTIA Cybersecurity Analyst

## 📦 Project Overview

Lou Luxe is an e-commerce hair store hosted on Azure, featuring:
- A modern frontend hosted via Azure Static Web Apps or App Service
- Backend data managed with Azure SQL Database
- Security and monitoring with Azure Key Vault, Defender, and Sentinel

## 🚀 Technologies Used

- Azure App Service / Static Web App
- Azure SQL Database
- Azure Key Vault
- Azure Monitor, Log Analytics, Sentinel
- GitHub Actions (CI/CD)
- HTML/CSS/JavaScript or React
- PowerShell / Terraform / Bicep (optional for deployment)

## 🧱 Architecture
